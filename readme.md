# Demo: Frequency Response Estimation

This repository contains a demo for generating a frequency response using input and output data. The data is generated from experiments using excitation signals from both pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) and sinusoidal signals.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the sysID_example.m to see the demo in action.

## Dependencies

- tested under MATLAB 2022
- should be compatible for MATLAB 2015 and beyond
