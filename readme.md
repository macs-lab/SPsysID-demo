# Frequency Response Estimation: A Demonstration 

[Cover](./coverpage.png)

Welcome to our repository. Here, you'll find a demonstration of generating a frequency response using input and output data. This data is primarily derived from pseudo experiments conducted using excitation signals from both pseudo-random binary sequences (PRBS) and sinusoidal signals.

## How to Use
- Initiate by cloning this repository.
- Execute the sysID_example.m file to visualize the demonstration.

## Software Requirements
- Tested on MATLAB 2022
- Backwards compatible with MATLAB 2015 and subsequent releases
